# TrailAccessibility

Find trails in all 50 states and DC that everyone can enjoy!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'trail_accessibility'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install trail_accessibility

## Usage

Start the program to choose from 51 indexed States (and DC!) to find accessible trails. Once you choose a location, indexed trails for the State are displayed by trail distance (shortest to longest). You will then be given the option to view trails made of asphalt. At this point, you can select a particular trail to view more information about it, or you can choose to go back up to the 51 orginal options to start again.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
